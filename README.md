## DS3 Group Project<br>
Jesse, Harsha, Shinu, Jenna

### Organization:
Individual folders are for WIP notebooks and to monitor process per individual. Overall final presentation and related photos/notebooks are in the origin folder.

### Overview: 
Open ended project analyzing Medium.com data.
Web scraping Medium.com articles and analyzing text using exploratory data visualizations. Compiling summary statistics and insights of the data.

Task: classify articles based on text into corresponding topics. Working on modeling using NLP best practices (normalization, tokenization, etc). Used tf-idf to quantify words. Various models (Decision Trees, KNN, and a more advanced model) used to compare metrics through confusion matrices (accuracy isn't necessarily the best route to go with multiclass classifications).

### Logistics:
Presented final results at the end of the Fall 2019 UCSD quarter to professors in data science and other project groups. Final paper of results pending.

Our group was selected as one of the three out of six to continue on next quarter with the project. 

### Future Directions:
Working with the text data more in depth. Focus on learning deep learning topics (how to build a basic NN, loss functions, etc). 

### References:
The [Medium.com](Medium.com) website was used to webscrape from. References for individual parts can be found within the respective notebooks.
